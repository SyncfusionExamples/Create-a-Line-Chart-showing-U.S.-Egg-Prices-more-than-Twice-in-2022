# Create a Line Chart showing U.S. Egg Prices more than Twice in 2022

we are going to create a line chart to visualize the rising average egg prices in the U.S. using the Syncfusion .NET MAUI line chart control. This control is supported on both desktop (Windows and MacCatalyst) and mobile platforms (Android and iOS). 

The national average price for a dozen large Grade A eggs has more than doubled from $1.93 in January to $4.25 in December 2022. This sample demonstrates how to create a line chart in .NET MAUI (SfCartesianChart) showing U.S. egg prices more than twice in 2022.
